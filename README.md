# Graduation Project with Vulnerabilities

My graduation project is an app which has intentional use of vulnerabilities - like SQL injection, Android cache keyboard, developer backdoor and so on.  
In the future I will add to my GIT version of this app with fixed vulnerabilities.

## About app

This application will be similar to Snapchat. Users will be able to share their photos with others, photos will be deleted after short amount of time.
Currently it is very early version.
